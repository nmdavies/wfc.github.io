For example, Lee et al., 2018 found that the effect estimates of genome-wide significant SNPs for years of education, discovered in a population-based GWAS of unrelated individuals, attenuated by around one-half in within-sibship models which control for population stratification, assortative mating and parental indirect genetic effects. Consistent with this, Kong and colleagues (2018) found evidence for indirect parental genetic effects in 21,637 individuals with genotyped parents, showing that non-inherited genetic variants related to parental education influenced offspring outcomes in the DeCODE study. Howe et al., 2022 compared population-based GWAS estimates with within-sibship GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes in a sample of 178,086 siblings. They found that the within-sibship estimates were substantially attenuated for some phenotypes, particularly socioeconomic phenotypes such as educational attainment and age at first birth. These findings illustrate the importance of within-family models for decomposing population-based GWAS estimates into the different sources of SNP-phenotype associations, such as direct and indirect genetic effects.\nGWAS using parent-offspring data is particularly useful for disentangling the different sources of genetic association. In trio and duo studies, we can directly control for parental genotype, which allows us to both control for and estimate the indirect genetic effects of parents. We will conduct a consortium-based parent-offspring GWAS to investigate differences between population-based and within-family GWAS estimates. We will also compare parent-offspring GWAS estimates with the within-sibship GWAS estimates.\nResearch question: To what extent do differences between population and within-family SNP-phenotype associations differ, and how do familial and demographic factors affect downstream analysis of GWAS summary data?\nWe are conducting GWAS of 25 phenotypes using data from studies with siblings and relevant phenotypes.

    "text": "Project 2: MZ GWAS of variance\nLeads: Elham Assray, Teemu Palviainen, Patrica Monroe, Neil Davies, Gibran Hemani, Jaakko Kaprio\nThe majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date have focused on identifying genetic markers associated with phenotype means. Contrastingly, much less is understood about genetic markers which influence phenotypic variation (variance quantitative trait loci; vQTL). The association of such markers with phenotypic variation may reflect interactions with environmental factors, as is thought to be the case for the adiposity influencing variant near/in FTO, or may capture biological mechanisms of an allele leading directly to higher variability. Therefore, identification of vQTL could improve understanding of underlying biology as well as the interplay between genetics and the environment.\nPrevious research into vQTLs has largely focused on obesity-related traits and predominantly used non-family based methods; for example, two recent studies (Young, Wauthier et al. 2018, Wang, Zhang et al. 2019) using UK Biobank data. An orthogonal approach to identify vQTL is to use a family-based method where we evaluate if there are genetic effects on phenotypic differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins. MZ twins share the same genotype at the vast majority of the genome but will often have discernible phenotypic differences. This MZ twin approach for identifying vQTL has been used previously for lipids on a sample of around 2,000 twin-pairs (Surakka, Whitfield et al. 2012) and in emotional symptoms in a sample of around 1,000 twin-pairs (Keers, Coleman et al. 2016). In this more recent study, the authors showed that a polygenic score created using the results of the GWAS moderated the effects of parenting and treatment response in two further samples.\nWe propose to extend previous work with a larger sample size and with the inclusion of additional phenotypes. This will involve a collaborative meta-analysis GWAS of associations between genetic variation and phenotypic differences between monozygotic twins for a variety of physical and psychological phenotypes (e.g. height, body mass index, lipids, depression and anxiety and educational attainment). A full description of the analysis can be found in the statistical analysis plan.\nCode Github repository containing an example pipeline with relevant scripts can be found here. As with the sibling GWAS, this automates most of the process of running the analysis, creating the study summary data and packages summary associations (SNP-phenotype associations) up for upload to KCL/University of Helsinki servers. Again, we will meta-analyze the summary data across the studies, and make summary data publicly available.\nPre-print We have finished a first draft of this paper and uploaded to ResearchSquare, you can find the full paper here."

Nat Genet 54, 581–592 (2022).\nEstimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height.

J. et al. Educational attainment, health outcomes and mortality: a within-sibship Mendelian randomization study. International Journal of Epidemiology 52, 1579–1591 (2023).\nBackground: Previous Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using population samples (population MR) have provided evidence for beneficial effects of educational attainment on health outcomes in adulthood. However, estimates from these studies may have been susceptible to bias from population stratification, assortative mating and indirect genetic effects due to unadjusted parental genotypes. MR using genetic association estimates derived from within-sibship models (within-sibship MR) can avoid these potential biases because genetic differences between siblings are due to random segregation at meiosis.\nMethods: Applying both population and within-sibship MR, we estimated the effects of genetic liability to educational attainment on body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and all-cause mortality. MR analyses used individual-level data on 72 932 siblings from UK Biobank and the Norwegian HUNT study, and summary-level data from a within-sibship Genome-wide Association Study including &gt;140 000 individuals.\nResults: Both population and within-sibship MR estimates provided evidence that educational attainment decreased BMI, cigarette smoking and SBP. Genetic variant–outcome associations attenuated in the within-sibship model, but genetic variant–educational attainment associations also attenuated to a similar extent. Thus, within-sibship and population MR estimates were largely consistent. The within-sibship MR estimate of education on mortality was imprecise but consistent with a putative effect.\nConclusions: These results provide evidence of beneficial individual-level effects of education (or liability to education) on adulthood health, independently of potential demographic and family-level confounders.\n\n\n\nDavies, N. M. et al. The importance of family-based sampling for biobanks.

So far, biobanks have largely pursued a population-based sampling strategy, where the individual is the unit of sampling, and familial relatedness occurs sporadically and by chance. This strategy has been remarkably efficient and successful, leading to thousands of scientific discoveries across multiple research domains, and plans for the next wave of biobanks are underway. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of a complementary sampling strategy for future biobanks based on oversampling of close genetic relatives. Such family-based samples facilitate research that clarifies causal relationships between putative risk factors and outcomes, particularly in estimates of genetic effects, because they enable analyses that reduce or eliminate confounding due to familial and demographic factors.

This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes. However, environmental sensitivity genetic variants have proven challenging to detect. GWAS of monozygotic twin differences is a family-based variance analysis method, which is more robust to systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from up to 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of monozygotic phenotypic differences in children and adolescents/adults for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism, and wellbeing. The SNP-heritability of variance in these phenotypes were estimated (h2: 0% to 18%), but were imprecise. We identified a total of 13 genome-wide significant associations (SNP, gene, and gene-set), including genes related to stress-reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. Monozygotic twins are an important new source of evidence about the genetics of environmental sensitivity."
