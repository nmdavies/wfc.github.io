<p><strong>4. MZ GWAS</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4333635/v1">Assary, E. et al. Genetics of environmental sensitivity to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: evidence from GWAS of monozygotic twins. Preprint at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4333635/v1 (2024).</a></p>

<p>Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes. However, environmental sensitivity genetic variants have proven challenging to detect. GWAS of monozygotic twin differences is a family-based variance analysis method, which is more robust to systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from up to 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of monozygotic phenotypic differences in children and adolescents/adults for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism, and wellbeing. The SNP-heritability of variance in these phenotypes were estimated (h2: 0% to 18%), but were imprecise. We identified a total of 13 genome-wide significant associations (SNP, gene, and gene-set), including genes related to stress-reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. Monozygotic twins are an important new source of evidence about the genetics of environmental sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>3. Importance of family-based biobanks</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07721-5">Davies, N. M. et al. The importance of family-based sampling for biobanks. Nature 634, 795–803 (2024).</a></p>

<p>Biobanks aim to improve our understanding of health and disease by collecting and analysing diverse biological and phenotypic information in large samples. So far, biobanks have largely pursued a population-based sampling strategy, where the individual is the unit of sampling, and familial relatedness occurs sporadically and by chance. This strategy has been remarkably efficient and successful, leading to thousands of scientific discoveries across multiple research domains, and plans for the next wave of biobanks are underway. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of a complementary sampling strategy for future biobanks based on oversampling of close genetic relatives. Such family-based samples facilitate research that clarifies causal relationships between putative risk factors and outcomes, particularly in estimates of genetic effects, because they enable analyses that reduce or eliminate confounding due to familial and demographic factors. Family-based biobank samples would also shed new light on fundamental questions across multiple fields that are often difficult to explore in population-based samples. Despite the potential for higher costs and greater analytical complexity, the many advantages of family-based samples should often outweigh their potential challenges.</p>

<p><strong>2. Within Family Mendelian randomization</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/5/1579/7193346">Howe, L. J. et al. Educational attainment, health outcomes and mortality: a within-sibship Mendelian randomization study. International Journal of Epidemiology 52, 1579–1591 (2023).</a></p>

<p>Background: Previous Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using population samples (population MR) have provided evidence for beneficial effects of educational attainment on health outcomes in adulthood. However, estimates from these studies may have been susceptible to bias from population stratification, assortative mating and indirect genetic effects due to unadjusted parental genotypes. MR using genetic association estimates derived from within-sibship models (within-sibship MR) can avoid these potential biases because genetic differences between siblings are due to random segregation at meiosis.</p>

<p>Methods: Applying both population and within-sibship MR, we estimated the effects of genetic liability to educational attainment on body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and all-cause mortality. MR analyses used individual-level data on 72 932 siblings from UK Biobank and the Norwegian HUNT study, and summary-level data from a within-sibship Genome-wide Association Study including &gt;140 000 individuals.</p>

<p>Results: Both population and within-sibship MR estimates provided evidence that educational attainment decreased BMI, cigarette smoking and SBP. Genetic variant–outcome associations attenuated in the within-sibship model, but genetic variant–educational attainment associations also attenuated to a similar extent. Thus, within-sibship and population MR estimates were largely consistent. The within-sibship MR estimate of education on mortality was imprecise but consistent with a putative effect.</p>

<p>Conclusions: These results provide evidence of beneficial individual-level effects of education (or liability to education) on adulthood health, independently of potential demographic and family-level confounders.</p>

<p><strong>1. Sibling GWAS</strong></p>

<p>Howe, L. J. et al. Within-sibship genome-wide association analyses decrease bias in estimates of direct genetic effects. Nat Genet 54, 581–592 (2022).</p>

<p>Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects.</p>
