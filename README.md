# Website for the Within Families Consortium


## Local development

For local development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html)
3. Run `quarto preview` in the root directory of the repository to see the website in your browser locally. It should automatically open a new tab in your browser with the website.
4. Make changes to the `.qmd` files etc. The browser will automatically update to reflect the changes.

You can modify the markdown files and the new changes will be reflected in the browser in realtime.

## Deployment

The website's html files will be built automatically and saved in the `docs/` folder. Once these changes are pushed to GitHub, the updated pages will be automatically deployed to the live website.
